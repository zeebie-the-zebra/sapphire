"""Ghost message envelope assembly — behavior tests.

`core/ghost_messages.py` (NEW in 2.6.4, 209 lines) had ZERO test coverage.
It runs on every chat turn AND is the rail for plugin contributions to the
LLM prompt. Two ship-blocker fixes shipped 2026-05-14:
  - Non-string ghost_text from a plugin no longer crashes the chat turn
    (was: AttributeError on .strip(), produced consecutive assistants in
    chat history, wedged Claude alternation).
  - Sentinel single source of truth (claude.py imports _ENVELOPE_HEADER
    instead of hardcoding).

These tests guard against regressions on both fixes plus baseline behavior.
