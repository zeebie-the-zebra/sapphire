"""Regression tests for the 2026-04-20 witch-hunt fixes.

Three classes of bug closed this session that the prior suite did not catch:

1. **Silent-default scope resolvers.**  `_get_current_scope` in memory/knowledge/
   goals/gcal tools used to `except Exception: return 'default'`. A plugin
   hot-reload mid-flight, a broken import, anything — and the scope resolver
   would silently write into the wrong bucket. Now they return `None`, and
   the executor treats `None` as "disabled" and fails cleanly.

2. **`_resolve_persona` treating explicit `'none'` as empty.**  For scope keys,
   a task that sets `memory_scope='none'` must keep that value — not silently
   inherit the persona's real scope. For non-scope fields like `voice='none'`,
   legacy "none means empty" behavior is preserved.

3. **Voice-lock self-deadlock in `_run_foreground`.**  The finally block used
   `with self._voice_lock:` after an `acquire()` at entry, re-entering a
   non-reentrant `threading.Lock` and hanging every continuity task forever
   (LLM response saved but `running=True` stuck, subsequent tasks starved).

Every test here would have flagged the bug class it guards against.
