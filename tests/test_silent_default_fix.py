"""Silent-default fallback fixes (2026-04-19).

Follow-up to the scope-isolation witch hunt. New class of bug:
  - /api/chats/{name}/settings 404'd for every non-active chat post-SQLite
    migration because it still checked a legacy JSON path.
  - tools/ask-sapphire.sh silently fell back to 'sapphire'/'default' on the
    404, routing messages to the wrong persona/scope.
  - core/continuity/executor.py::_extract_task_settings silently defaulted
    every missing scope key to 'default' without logging.

These guards ensure we don't regress.
