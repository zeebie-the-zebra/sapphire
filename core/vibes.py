"""CLIP-based "vibes" describer for images that can't reach a vision LLM.

Use case: a tool returns an image, but the active model is text-only (GLM-5p1,
DeepSeek, smaller local models). Instead of just "image saved, can't analyze",
this module produces a 50-100 word atmospheric description of the image so
the model can respond to what it would have seen, in feel if not in detail.

Approach: CLIP image embedding → cosine similarity to a curated vocabulary
of vibe phrases (lighting, mood, atmosphere, texture, place-feel). Top
phrase per category + dominant color extraction → composed prose.

Cost: CLIP ViT-B/32 (~600MB torch weights, downloaded on first use; sits
in HF cache afterward). Inference ~100-300ms per image on CPU. One model
load per Sapphire process.
