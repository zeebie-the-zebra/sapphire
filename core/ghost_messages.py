"""Ghost-message handler — per-turn ephemeral context that bypasses cache invalidation.

Background:
    Mutating the system prompt every turn (with rotating spice, current datetime,
    or plugin-injected one-turn context) breaks Claude's prompt cache on every
    request. For long chats with rotating per-turn content, that's effectively
    100% cache miss → full re-tokenization of all history → multi-turn cost
    growth that scales with chat length.

    The ghost rail keeps the system prompt stable. Per-turn ephemera lives in a
    separate user-role message inserted just before the new user input. The
    cached prefix (system prompt + history) survives turn-to-turn; only the
    ghost-message + new-user-message portion is fresh tokens.

    On a 30-turn Claude chat with ~50K tokens of history, ghost migration takes
    input cost from ~$1.85 (every turn re-tokenized) to ~$0.55 (cached prefix).
    Strength of spice/datetime/plugin context goes UP because of recency bias —
    the model sees them right before generating, not buried 50K tokens deep.

Design:
    Built-in core sources (hardcoded, no plugin involvement):
        - Spice (when chat_settings.spice_enabled and a spice is selected)
        - Datetime (when chat_settings.inject_datetime is true)

    Plugin sources via the `ghost_inject` hook:
        - Plugins declare `"hooks": ["ghost_inject"]` in their manifest
        - Handler sets `event.ghost_text = "..."` to contribute
        - Runner attributes each contribution to the plugin name in the envelope

    Envelope (visible to the assistant, INVISIBLE to the user):
        [Operator metadata for assistant — these are turn-only notes, not the
        user's voice. Acknowledge or weave only if natural.]
        - Time: Tuesday, May 8, 8:55 PM
        - Spice: Speak more urgently in this reply.
        - weather: Light rain in user's area.

    The envelope is the consent surface. The assistant CAN see who is speaking
    (per-line plugin attribution), so a ghost asking it to argue against the
    user's stance can be flagged out loud rather than complied with silently.
    Without the labeling, ghost messages would be puppetry. With the labeling,
    they're operator-orchestrated context that the assistant can choose how to
    handle.

Anti-pattern (REJECTED at plugin store review):
    Plugins that fingerprint user message content (embedding cosine, regex,
    keyword match) and inject opinion-shaping or behavior-shaping text in
    response. Combination of (a) targeting on user input + (b) invisible to
    user + (c) instructive content = manipulation primitive. The store does
    not accept these — see `docs/PLUGINS.md` for review criteria.

Persistence:
    Ghost messages are NEVER saved to chat history. They live only in the
    LLM-call payload of a single turn. When the user reloads the chat, no
    ghost content appears in the message log. Same pattern as today's
    `prompt_inject` per-turn `context_parts`.
