class HookEvent:
    """Mutable event object passed through hook handlers.

    Handlers can mutate any field. Changes are visible to subsequent handlers.

    Hook points (in pipeline order):
        post_stt:          After voice transcription — mutate `input` to correct STT
        on_wake:           Wakeword detected — notification only (must return fast)
        pre_chat:          Before LLM — mutate `input`, set `skip_llm`/`response` to bypass
        prompt_inject:     During prompt build — append to `context_parts` (system prompt)
        ghost_inject:      Per-turn ephemeral content — set `ghost_text` to inject a
                           non-persisted operator-metadata note into THIS turn's LLM
                           call only. Goes through the ghost-message rail (a labeled
                           user-role message just before the new user input), never
                           saved to chat history, attributed to the contributing
                           plugin in the envelope so the assistant can see who's
                           talking. Use for time-sensitive context (weather, calendar,
                           ambient state). Subject to elevated store review — this
                           hook can shape replies invisibly to the user, so plugins
                           must declare WHAT they inject and WHY in their manifest.
                           Plugins that fingerprint user content and inject opinion-
                           shaping text get rejected (Vanta-shape). 2026-05-08.
        post_llm:          After LLM response, before save — mutate `response` to filter/translate
        post_chat:         After response saved — observational (`input`, `response`)
        pre_execute:       Before tool call — mutate `arguments`, block with `skip_llm`
        post_execute:      After tool call — observational (`function_name`, `result`)
        pre_tts:           Before speech — mutate `tts_text`, cancel with `skip_tts`. metadata['tts_client'] = calling TTSClient
        post_tts:          After playback — observational (`tts_text`, metadata has `duration`)
        provider_switched: After TTS/STT/embed provider hot-swap. metadata: `kind` (tts|stt|embed), `provider` (new key). Observational — plugins warm caches / reset state.

    Fields:
        input: User's message / STT transcription (mutable in post_stt, pre_chat)
        skip_llm: Set True to bypass LLM entirely (voice commands, cached responses)
        response: Direct response text when skip_llm is True / post_chat final response
        context_parts: Append strings to inject into system prompt (prompt_inject hooks)
        ghost_text: Set in `ghost_inject` to contribute a per-turn ephemeral note.
                    Goes into the ghost message envelope, never persisted, attributed
                    by `ghost_label` so the assistant sees which plugin spoke.
        ghost_label: Plugin name for ghost attribution. Auto-set by the runner from
                     the registering plugin's manifest. Plugins should not override.
        stop_propagation: Set True to prevent lower-priority hooks from firing
        config: System config object (read-only by convention)
        metadata: Arbitrary data — may include 'system' (VoiceChatSystem instance)
        function_name: Tool name for pre_execute/post_execute hooks
        arguments: Tool arguments for pre_execute (mutable — plugins can modify)
        result: Tool result for post_execute
        tts_text: Text about to be spoken for pre_tts (mutable) / spoken text for post_tts
        skip_tts: Set True in pre_tts to cancel TTS entirely
        ephemeral: Set True with skip_llm to show response without persisting to history
