"""Streaming chunkifier for TTS — turns an LLM token stream into speakable
chunks at sentence/paragraph boundaries (with max-char fallback).

Used by the v2.7.0 streaming TTS pipeline. Pure-Python: no Sapphire imports,
no I/O, no Kokoro. Unit-testable in isolation.

Behavior:
- Strips `<think>...</think>`, `<reasoning>...</reasoning>`, `<tools>...</tools>`
  blocks and ```code fences``` from the stream — even when the opening tag
  arrives in one token and the closer arrives in a later token.
- Detects sentence ends via `.!?` followed by whitespace+capital
  (so `Dr. Smith`, `3.14`, `3:45 PM`, URLs don't split).
- Paragraph breaks (`\\n\\n`) always split.
- Ellipsis (`...`) is its own boundary with a longer post-pause.
- Secondary punctuation (`;` `:`) splits only when the chunk has already
  grown past max_chars * 0.5 — avoids tiny chunks on natural prose pauses.
- If no boundary appears within `max_chars`, force-splits on the last
  whitespace inside the window.
- Empty/all-stripped stream yields no chunks.

Each yielded chunk carries metadata for the downstream player (boundary
type + suggested post-chunk pause).
