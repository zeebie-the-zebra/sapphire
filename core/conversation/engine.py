"""Conversation-mode turn-state machine (v3 Rollout 2a).

PURE LOGIC. Fed `(pcm_frame, is_speech)` decisions one frame at a time, it runs
the conversation turn cycle and emits actions through two callbacks. No audio
device, no VAD model, no LLM live here — the front-door/driver injects those
(Rollout 2b), which keeps this unit-testable and identical across the browser
and local front-doors.

States
------
  IDLE          waiting for the user to start talking
  USER_SPEAKING accumulating the user's utterance until end-of-speech
  RESPONDING    STT/LLM/TTS turn running; watching for a barge-in

Transitions
-----------
  IDLE          --speech onset--------------------------------> USER_SPEAKING
  USER_SPEAKING --silence >= endpoint_silence_ms,
                  speech  >= min_speech_ms---------------------> on_turn(audio); RESPONDING
  USER_SPEAKING --endpoint but speech < min_speech_ms (blip)---> IDLE  (discard)
  RESPONDING    --speech >= barge_hold_ms, barge ARMED---------> on_barge_in(); USER_SPEAKING (new utterance)
  RESPONDING    --turn_finished() (TTS done, no barge)---------> IDLE

Barge arming (2026-07-06): entering RESPONDING DISARMS barge-in; the driver
calls arm_barge() when prose actually starts flowing (first content/tts_chunk).
Speech during LLM preprocessing or thinking is ignored — there's nothing to
interrupt yet, and firing barges there killed turns before she could answer
(a user who talk-pauses-talks in that window cancelled every turn).

Callback contract
-----------------
  on_turn(pcm_bytes)  fired at end-of-utterance. MUST be non-blocking — the
                      driver dispatches STT/LLM/TTS on its own thread and returns
                      immediately, because push_frame runs on the audio path.
  on_barge_in()       fired when the user talks over the response. MUST be quick
                      (set a cancel flag). The engine then captures the new utterance.

  turn_finished()     the driver calls this when the response (TTS) completes with
                      no barge-in, returning the engine to IDLE.
  arm_barge()         the driver calls this when the response becomes interruptible
                      (prose streaming / audio playing).

PCM frames are int16 little-endian bytes; frame duration is derived from length,
so timing is deterministic (no wall clock) — feed known-size frames in tests.
