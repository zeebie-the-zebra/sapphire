# Image Generation

Sapphire can generate images using SDXL via a separate server. The AI describes scenes, and character descriptions stay consistent across images.

## Setup

1. **Run the image server** - Follow instructions at [ddxfish/sapphire-image-api](https://github.com/ddxfish/sapphire-image-api)
2. **Connect Sapphire** - Settings → Plugins → Image Generation
3. **Enter your server URL** (e.g., `http://localhost:5153`)
4. **Click Test** to verify connection

## Settings

### Character Descriptions

The AI writes prompts using "me" (itself) and "you" (the human). These get replaced with physical descriptions you define, keeping characters consistent across all generated images.

**Example:** AI writes "me and you walking in the park" → becomes "A woman with long brown hair and you walking in the park"

### Generation Defaults

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Width/Height | Image dimensions (256-2048) |
| Steps | More steps = better quality, slower (1-100) |
| CFG Scale | How closely to follow the prompt (1-20) |
| Scheduler | Sampling algorithm (dpm++_2m_karras recommended) |

### Other Options

- **Negative Prompt** - Things to avoid (ugly, blurry, etc.)
- **Static Keywords** - Always appended to prompts (e.g., "wide shot")

## Usage

Once configured, the AI can use the `generate_scene_image` tool automatically when describing scenes. Images appear inline in the chat.

## Reference for AI

Generate images via SDXL server using generate_scene_image tool.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Separate image server running (sapphire-image-api)
- Server URL configured in Settings > Plugins > Image Generation
- generate_scene_image tool in active toolset

HOW TO USE:
- Call generate_scene_image(scene_description) with the scene description
- Use "me" for AI character, "you" for user - auto-replaced with configured descriptions
- Image appears inline in chat

PROMPT TIPS:
- Describe scene, not technical params
- "me and you sitting by a campfire at sunset" works
- Static keywords and negative prompt auto-appended

SETTINGS (user configures, not AI):
- Width/Height: 256-2048 pixels
- Steps: quality vs speed (more = better, slower)
- CFG Scale: prompt adherence (1-20)
- Character descriptions: physical appearance for "me" and "you"

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- "Tool not found": Add generate_scene_image to toolset
- "Connection failed": Check image server running, verify URL in settings
- Bad images: User should adjust steps, CFG, or negative prompt in settings
