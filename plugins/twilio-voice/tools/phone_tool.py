# Phone tool — Sapphire places real calls (Twilio outbound).
"""
phone_call: dial a whitelisted contact and run the live conversation engine on
the bridged call. The People whitelist is the blast shield (email pattern):
only contacts with 'Allow AI to call' + a phone number are dialable — no
direct-number parameter in v1. The heavy lifting (REST originate, pending-call
correlation, ephemeral chat spin-off, report-back) lives in the plugin daemon.
